        We understand that traditional internships can be difficult to obtain,
        especially in today's competitive job market. That's why we created
        Simplbyte - to provide students with the opportunity to work on projects
        and gain practical experience, all from the comfort of their own homes.
        Our virtual internships offer a unique and innovative way for students
        to work on projects and gain hands-on experience in various industries.
        Our internships are designed to be flexible, allowing students to fit
        them into their busy schedules. Our goal is to help students build their
        skills, network with professionals, and stand out in the job market. We
        believe that everyone should have the opportunity to launch their
        careers, and we are committed to making that a reality.
